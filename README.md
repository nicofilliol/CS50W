# CS50W

This is my personal repository for _Harvard's CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript_ online course. It will continously be updated with notes from the lectures as well as the projects that have to be done for completing the course. 

#### About the course
Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, I will learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By course's end, I will emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower me to design and deploy applications on the Internet.

#### What I'll learn
* Git
* HTML, CSS
* Flask
* SQL
* APIs
* JavaScript
* Front Ends
* Django
* Testing, CI/CD
* Scalability
* Security
